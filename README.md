# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript I started this project by setting up my HTML template. I then started with my JavaScript and had to check to see what data I was receiving from the API so that I could choose what I wanted to use for my project. 
A j-frame had to be included for media returned from the API.
